# Code-Quiz-C4-
# Description
This is a simple quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to take a quiz and get a score based on their answers. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions and the user has a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. When the page is loaded, it renders the score which is saved in the local storage (if there is one). At the end of the quiz, users are able to save their scores and initials in the local storage.
